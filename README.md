# ESoWC2020

This is a repository showing the work I do for the online Internship challenge ESoWC 2020

The section "TestSamples" shows files for the sample project I made for my ESoWC application.
I've used Bokeh to make a dashboard to visualise different datasets.

The files are in an ipynb format, kindly download both example.csv and example_profile.csv before
running the files as these two are the data files for it.
